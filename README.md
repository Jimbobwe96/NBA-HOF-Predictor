# NBA-HOF-Predictor
The Naismith Pro Basketball Hall of Fame is a sacred site in the hoops world. The honor of being inducted is revered by players and fans as an accomplishment worth a career of blood, sweat, and tears. But what reliably contrives a hall of fame career? Truth be told, selection criteria is highly subjective. For some, it's legacy. For others, statistical excellence, or perhaps sheer on-court domination.   

I built and trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to try and predict whether or not a player's career is Hall of Fame worthy. Using data from the ***nba-api*** python package and tensorflow, I was able to process statistical data and awards/accolades to discern who transcends greatness.
